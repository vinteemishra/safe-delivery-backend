Data collection
===============

The SDA App will collect events from various places in the application. All events
will be sent to Azure Table Storage.


Event format from App
---------------------
Events have the following format:

```
  {
    "ts": 1234,
    "appId": "xx",
    "userId": "yy",
    "sessId": "zz",
    "appVersion: "x.y.z",
    "location": {
      "type": "network",
      "lat": 1.11111,
      "lon": 2.2222
    },
    "eventType": "app_start",
    "eventData": "1.45"
  }
```

| Property | Rqd? | Description |
| ---------| -----|-------------|
| ts       |  y   | Timestamp the event was generated, specified as the number of milliseconds elapsed since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC as returned by Javascipt's Date.now() function.|
| appId    |  y   | Unique id generated by each app installation |
| userId   |  n   | Id of the logged in user, if any |
| sessId   |  y   | Unique id for the current app session |
| appVersion   |  y   | App version. Format is MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH  |

| lat      |  n   | Location latitude, in decimal degrees |
| lon      |  n   | Location longitude, in decimal degrees |
| eventType|  y   | The type of event. See table below for possible event types |

Alot of the chapters have no name in the key (\_[timestamp]). Which makes them more difficult to read. The lack of name comes from them not having a blank name in the CMS. This is manually set by Maternity, when they create chapters in master so there is no coded rules, but as it is used now blank names generally mean that there is only one chapter. chapterKey was added in version 3.0.8, so data from earlier versions will not have this property|

Alot of the chapters have no name in the key (_[timestamp]). Which makes them more difficult to read. The lack of name comes from them not having a blank name in the CMS. This is manually set by Maternity, when they create chapters in master. As it is used now blank names mean that there is only one chapter. chapterKey was added in version 3.0.8, so data from earlier versions will not have this property. |

Backend API for events
----------------------
Events are POSTed to the URL ```https://sda.maternity.dk/api/public/events```

The body should be an array of app events in JSON format.

It is ok for a single POST request to contain identical ```ts``` values, but separate requests
should have unique ```ts``` values.

The following HTTP codes can be returned

| Code | Description                                                                       |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 200  | All events were stored |
| 400  | There was a problem with the data, either invalid JSON format or missing properties |
| 500  | Something unexpected happened |

There's no reason in retrying the operation when a 400 is returned. A 500 code _may\_ indicate a temporary failure
on e.g. Azure so it may make sense to retry the operation later.

Event storage in Azure
----------------------
Events are stored in Azure Table Storage. The appId is used as PartitionKey and
ts + event index is used as RowKey.

A Timestamp is automatically added for each row.


Events in SQL Server
--------------------
Events are copied from Table Storage to a SQL Server instance every hour by an Azure Data Factory
pipeline.

The SQL Server table has the following format

```
CREATE TABLE DevEvents (
  PartitionKey NVARCHAR(32) NOT NULL ,
  RowKey NVARCHAR(32) NOT NULL ,
  ServerTime DATETIMEOFFSET NOT NULL,
  EventTime DATETIMEOFFSET NOT NULL ,
  AppId NVARCHAR(32) NOT NULL ,
  SessId NVARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
  UserId NVARCHAR(32),
  EventType NVARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
  EventData NVARCHAR(1024) NOT NULL,
  LocType NVARCHAR(32),
  Lat DOUBLE PRECISION,
  Lon DOUBLE PRECISION,
  Slice BINARY(32)
)
```
The slice column is used by the ADF pipeline to manage incremental updates and can be ignored.
