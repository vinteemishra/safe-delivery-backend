        "content": "<h1>Preamble</h1><p>PEP is Post-Exposure Prophylaxis.</p><p>It means taking antiretroviral medicines (ART) after being potentially exposed to HIV to prevent becoming infected.</p><h1>Indications and Usage</h1><p>PEP should be considered if you’ve had a recent possible exposure to HIV at work.</p><p>Report your exposure to your supervisor, and seek medical attention immediately.</p><p>Occupational transmission of HIV to health care workers is extremely rare, and the proper use of safety devices and barriers can help minimize the risk of exposure while caring for patients with HIV.</p><h1>Dosage and Administration</h1><p>PEP must be started within 72 hours after a recent possible exposure to HIV, but the sooner you start the PEP, the better. </p><p>Every hour counts. </p><p>If you're prescribed PEP, you'll need to take it once or twice daily for 28 days.</p><p>PEP is effective in preventing HIV when administered correctly, but not 100%.</p><p>PEP normally consists of three anti-HIV drugs, from two of the different classes.</p><p>(A regimen for post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV with two ARV drugs is effective, but three drugs are preferred).</p><p>TDF + 3TC (or FTC) + EFV as a fixed-dose combination is recommended as the preferred option to initiate ART for adults and adolescents.</p><p>Remember to take an HIV test 3 months after exposure. </p><p>Pregnant and breastfeeding women can be treated with PEP.</p><h1>Contraindications</h1><p>Do not treat pregnant women with Efavirenz or Nevirapin.</p><h1>Adverse Reactions</h1><p>HIV treatment can cause side-effects which tend to be the worst when you first start taking them.</p><p>If you are taking PEP you may experience some unpleasant side-effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headaches and fatigue.</p><p>The drugs used in a course of PEP today are less likely to cause side-effects than those used in the past.</p>"
