Tocolytics should not be used in the following conditions: - preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) - chorioamnionitis - placental abruption - cardiac disease. CAUTION: see above, should not be the first drug of choice to treat hypertension.</p><p> </p><h1>Adverse Reactions</h1><p>Common adverse reactions are constipation, vasodilatation, edema, headache, flushing, dizzyness, tiredness, and itching. </p><p>Uncommon adverse reactions are nausea, dryness of the mouth, heart palpitations, respiratory distress, nose bleeding, joint pain, anxiety, sleeping disturbances, frequent urge for and painful urination, visual disturbances and allergic reactions. </p><p>Rare adverse reactions are urticaria and other severe allergic reactions.</p>"
